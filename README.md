# Tip-Calculator-Program

## General info
*This simple program calculates the amount of the bill plus tip for each person.*

### For example:
> If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.\
> Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6\
> The **final result** will be returned in 2 decimal places format, *e.g 33.60
